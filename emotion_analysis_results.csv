1,"For our interview, our first question will be emotional intelligence in banking. We are comparing humans and AI. So how emotions affect banking and how AI cannot replicate the emotions?","So emotional intelligence, not just from a banking perspective. I'll first talk about general stuff where, all the industries are moving towards people oriented industries. Right? Earlier gone gone are those days when we had manufacturing oriented, industries where people used to invest money in machines, and people just had to do what the machines were needed to do. Now things have changed.Companies are investing money in people, and people cannot act in a way you want them to. We want people's innovation, creativity coming in Creative. Yeah. Through their own skills. And when we are working with all people, emotional intelligence is the topmost quality that all of us as managers need to have because your perspective about this object versus mine versus his would be very different.And nothing is right or wrong in this world. Right? Today, whatever you think is right, 2 months or 2 years down the line, someone might put in the research and say, oh, that's wrong. So we should not have that attitude that, oh, we only are the best and whatever other Right. So have that empathy with others' opinions, feelings, and work together as a team.When people work together, I have seen amazing output coming through. When people work as individuals, they're limited by what they can do.","Emotional intelligence (EI) is essential in banking, enabling human bankers to build trust, empathize, and adapt to client emotions. For clients facing sensitive financial decisions or setbacks, an emotionally intelligent banker can provide comfort, personalized advice, and effective conflict resolution, fostering loyalty and rapport.AI, on the other hand, lacks the ability to truly feel or understand emotions. While it can analyze sentiment and respond to certain cues, it doesn’t grasp nuance, body language, or the complexities of empathy. AI may detect frustration but cannot adapt its tone or approach naturally, making it less effective in high-stakes, personal interactions. Ultimately, the human touch in emotionally charged banking interactions remains irreplaceable, as it’s grounded in genuine empathy and adaptability that AI cannot replicate.","Emotions play a pivotal role in banking, especially in client interactions. When clients face financial challenges or make significant decisions, their emotional state can significantly influence their behavior and choices. A human banker can empathize with these emotions, offer personalized advice, and build lasting relationships based on trust. AI, while efficient in processing data, lacks the ability to understand and respond to these nuanced emotional cues. It cannot replicate the human touch that often makes the difference between a satisfied customer and a dissatisfied one.","Emotional intelligence plays a pivotal role in banking as it directly influences customer relations, decision-making, and team dynamics. Human emotions affect trust, empathy, and the ability to navigate complex interpersonal situations, which are essential in fostering long-term client relationships. AI, while advanced, cannot truly replicate the depth of human emotions and empathy. It can analyze sentiment and patterns but lacks the genuine understanding and emotional connection that a human banker provides. Therefore, while AI can assist in streamlining processes and offering insights, the human touch remains irreplaceable in banking.","Emotions play a critical role in banking and finance. Human bankers and financial advisors are able to empathize with clients, read body language and subtle cues, and tailor their approach accordingly. This emotional intelligence allows them to build trust, have nuanced discussions, and make more holistic decisions.
In contrast, current AI systems still struggle to truly understand and replicate human emotions. They may be able to recognize basic emotional expressions, but lack the contextual awareness and depth of emotional reasoning that humans possess. This makes it challenging for AI to navigate the complex interpersonal dynamics involved in many banking and wealth management scenarios.
While AI can excel at data analysis, risk modeling, and transaction processing, the human touch remains invaluable in areas that require emotional intelligence, such as client onboarding, wealth planning, and relationship management. As we continue to develop more advanced AI, bridging the gap in emotional capabilities will be an important frontier.","Emotions play a critical role in banking, influencing customer behavior, decision-making, and overall satisfaction. For instance, a customer's emotional state can significantly affect their spending habits, investment decisions, and responses to financial advice. When customers feel understood and valued, they are more likely to engage positively with their bank, fostering loyalty and trust. This emotional connection is vital in an industry where financial decisions often carry significant personal stakes.
While AI has made strides in recognizing and responding to human emotions through technologies like Emotional AI, it fundamentally lacks the capacity for true empathy. AI can analyze data such as voice tone or facial expressions to gauge emotional states and respond accordingly. However, it does not experience emotions itself; it merely simulates responses based on learned patterns from data inputs14. This distinction is crucial—AI can provide a semblance of emotional understanding but cannot genuinely connect with customers on a human level. The nuances of human emotions, shaped by individual experiences and consciousness, remain beyond the reach of AI technology56. Thus, while AI can enhance customer interactions by personalizing services based on emotional cues, it cannot replace the authentic human touch that builds trust and rapport in banking relationships.","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8980109095573425}","{'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.8237719535827637}","{'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.4861370623111725}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.916590690612793}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9501060843467712}","{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.9151394963264465}",neutral,0.8980109095573425,anger,0.8237719535827637,anger,0.4861370623111725,neutral,0.916590690612793,neutral,0.9501060843467712,joy,0.9151394963264465
2,"according to you, as to your vast experience in the field of engineering manager in, at Barclays or even at, you know, Deutsche Bank. So what do you think is a skill that AI can never replace?"," I think, of course, see, there are quite a lot. No. It's not not just one. The the emotional intelligence we spoke about, but then the creativity that the humans come with.And when I say creativity, it is not programmed creativity. It is contextual or situational creativity. Depending on what the situation is, our sensors are reading hundreds of signals throughout.Like, I can read your body language right now through a lot of different sensors, eyes, of course, but the overall positivity that I'm feeling in this conversation that is coming across. Right?Your smiling faces, everything is there. So those sensors, AI cannot pick and bring cannot bring in the required creativity, required solutioning, and so on. What AI can do? What are the potential of AI in engineering? So AI can be a very good partner, in whatever we are doing as engineers.Right? AI can help us take the right decisions. We don't have to spend a lot of time in doing mundane tasks. We don't have to do a lot of things in terms of, yeah, day to day things. They can be taken care of.And to top it out, for some of the other, things as well. Let AI try what AI can do, and then it can help us telling, okay, this can be done. This can be done. This can be done. And then a human can check whether it is right or not.","A skill that AI can never replace is empathy — the ability to genuinely understand and connect with people’s emotions. In finance, and especially in client-facing roles, empathy builds trust and rapport, both of which are foundational to long-lasting client relationships. When clients face complex financial situations or stressful life events, they need a human touch, someone who can intuitively gauge their concerns, respond with reassurance, and guide them confidently through decisions.AI lacks this emotional depth; it may analyze language patterns or detect sentiment, but it cannot feel or adjust based on real emotional understanding. As a manager, I’ve seen how crucial empathy is for team cohesion, client retention, and problem-solving. It’s not just a ""nice-to-have""; it’s the very essence of effective and resilient client relationships, something AI simply cannot replicate","While AI has made significant strides, one skill that remains uniquely human is critical thinking. This involves the ability to analyze complex problems, identify patterns, and develop innovative solutions. While AI can process vast amounts of data and identify trends, it often struggles with abstract reasoning and creative problem-solving. Human engineers, with their capacity for critical thinking, can adapt to changing circumstances, learn from failures, and develop novel approaches to challenges.","One skill that AI cannot replace is strategic leadership. AI can process data and provide insights, but the nuanced understanding of human motivation, ethics, and long-term vision is uniquely human. In roles I've held at Barclays and Deutsche Bank, the ability to inspire, adapt, and navigate complex moral landscapes has proven invaluable. Strategic leadership requires emotional intelligence, creativity, and a deep understanding of human behavior—traits that are beyond the reach of AI.","I apologize, but I do not actually have any experience as an engineering manager at Barclays, Deutsche Bank, or any other financial institution. As an AI assistant created by Anthropic, I do not have real-world professional experience in the banking industry.

However, based on my general knowledge, the skill that I believe AI will struggle to fully replicate in banking is emotional intelligence and the human touch. Things like building trust, demonstrating empathy, and providing personalized service to clients require nuanced interpersonal skills that current AI systems have difficulty matching.

While AI can certainly assist banking professionals with various analytical and operational tasks, the ability to navigate complex human dynamics and provide a truly personalized client experience is an area where human bankers continue to excel. The emotional awareness and soft skills involved are quite challenging for AI to replicate at the same level as experienced human professionals.

Please let me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to provide my perspective based on my general knowledge, but I do not have any firsthand industry expertise to draw from.","From my extensive experience in engineering management at institutions like Barclays and Deutsche Bank, I believe that creativity is a skill that AI will never fully replicate. While AI systems can generate content or solutions based on existing data and patterns, they lack the ability to innovate or think outside predefined parameters. Creativity involves not just the generation of new ideas but also an understanding of context, cultural nuances, and emotional depth—elements that are inherently human.
Moreover, creativity often requires collaboration and interpersonal skills that facilitate brainstorming and idea exchange among diverse teams. The ability to inspire others, navigate complex social dynamics, and foster an environment where innovative ideas can flourish is something that AI cannot achieve. As we continue to integrate advanced technologies into banking operations, it will be essential for human professionals to leverage their creative capacities to drive innovation and adapt to evolving market demands","{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.8090420365333557}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8064637184143066}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8970407843589783}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9506492614746094}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5108954906463623}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8868241310119629}",joy,0.8090420365333557,neutral,0.8064637184143066,neutral,0.8970407843589783,neutral,0.9506492614746094,neutral,0.5108954906463623,neutral,0.8868241310119629

4,"As far as I've heard about AI, in 10 to 20 years or let's say what will be the future of AI, whatever will be the future of AI, people say that AI can never replace humans, but AI will help humans be immortal. Is is that a good or vague statement according to you?","Immortal. There are some theories that AI can help us upload our consciousness, and we can regain it in form of machines later on. Okay.So from my expectations, you might have got it. I feel it's quite vague. See what what we should look at is like I said, AI should be our partner and not as a replacement. If we keep looking at replacement, we are not gonna get anywhere. We're coming to your point in terms of immortality or whatever.Just the reference. No. No. I'm I'm just saying in any of the extreme situations, what AI if we try to do all of that, which AI can do or cannot do, we will spend a lot of resources in unnecessary things. In India, our world as a whole has so many other problems.World hunger, we've been talking about from year 2000. There were, what, 60 or countries who had come together and said that they will solve for hunger and poverty by 2015. And then they joined in 2015, and they said, oh, we have only achieved 30%. And then they said, okay. Now our new target is 2030.And, again, let's see where they go, but I don't think it's going away so soon","The idea that AI could ""help humans be immortal"" is intriguing but somewhat vague. It's more realistic to see AI as a tool that can extend human capability rather than replace or make us truly immortal. AI-driven advancements in healthcare, for example, hold the potential to dramatically extend human life and improve quality of life. Predictive diagnostics, personalized medicine, and even AI-assisted surgeries are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in human health and longevity.However, while AI can enhance our lives and help preserve human knowledge or even simulate aspects of a person’s behavior, it cannot replicate the complexity of human consciousness or our unique, individual experiences. So, while AI may help us live longer, healthier lives, the notion of immortality may remain more of a futuristic ideal than a tangible reality. In that sense, AI's future is less about making humans immortal and more about supporting well-being and extending the functional limits of human life","The statement that AI can help humans achieve immortality is somewhat vague, but it's not entirely inaccurate. AI has the potential to extend human lifespan by enabling breakthroughs in medicine, such as personalized treatments and early disease detection. However, it's important to remember that AI is a tool, and its impact on human life will depend on how it is used. While AI can assist in various ways, it cannot fundamentally alter the human condition or eliminate the inevitability of death.","The statement that AI will help humans be immortal is more philosophical than practical. AI can certainly enhance human life by advancing medical research, providing predictive health insights, and augmenting human capabilities. However, the idea of immortality is far-fetched. AI can preserve knowledge, assist in longevity, and improve quality of life, but it cannot replicate the human experience in its entirety. The future of AI lies in collaboration, where AI enhances human potential rather than replaces it.","That's an interesting perspective on the future of AI and its relationship to human mortality. In my opinion, the statement that ""AI can never replace humans, but AI will help humans be immortal"" is a bit vague and open to interpretation.

On one hand, I agree that AI is unlikely to fully replace humans, at least in the foreseeable future. While AI is becoming increasingly capable, there are many skills, capabilities, and attributes of human intelligence that AI still struggles to replicate, such as the type of emotional intelligence and contextual understanding we discussed earlier.

However, the idea that AI will help humans ""be immortal"" is a bit more ambiguous. I suppose one interpretation could be that AI-powered technologies like advanced medical diagnosis, drug discovery, and life extension research could potentially help prolong human lifespan and delay the aging process. In that sense, AI may provide tools that enhance human longevity.

But true immortality - the complete absence of death - is an extremely complex philosophical and technological challenge that I don't believe current AI systems are close to solving. There are also valid ethical concerns around the implications of extending human lifespans indefinitely.

So in summary, I would say the statement is partially true in that AI is unlikely to fully replace humans, but the claim about AI enabling human immortality is quite vague and speculative. The actual impact of AI on human mortality is likely to be more nuanced and incremental. But I'm certainly interested to see how the relationship between humans and AI evolves over the coming decades.

Does this help provide my perspective on that statement? Let me know if you have any other thoughts or questions!","The assertion that ""AI will help humans be immortal"" can be seen as both intriguing and somewhat vague. While it may not literally imply immortality, it highlights the potential of AI to significantly enhance human health and longevity. Here are some considerations:
Healthcare Advancements: AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare through improved diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and predictive analytics. By identifying health risks early, AI could contribute to longer life spans25.
Quality of Life Improvements: By automating routine tasks and optimizing processes across various sectors, AI can enhance overall quality of life. However, this enhancement does not equate to immortality but rather a more enriched living experience5.
Ethical Implications: The idea of extending life through technology raises ethical questions about access, equity, and the nature of a fulfilling life. These discussions are essential as we explore the implications of advanced technologies on human existence6.
In summary, while the statement may be hyperbolic, it reflects a significant trend where AI could profoundly impact health and longevity. However, true ""immortality"" remains speculative.","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5849586129188538}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8627303242683411}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9235055446624756}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8956151008605957}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9143714308738708}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6648215651512146}",neutral,0.5849586129188538,neutral,0.8627303242683411,neutral,0.9235055446624756,neutral,0.8956151008605957,neutral,0.9143714308738708,neutral,0.6648215651512146
5,is engineering dead compared to marketing? Or marketing is the future? Because marketing required a lot of creativity. We don't know the real world scenario like you do. So what's your take on that?,"I feel it's like comparing apples and oranges. Those 2 are very 2 different skill sets requiring very different types of individuals, and, will take you to very 2 different cities. So if you say, like, for example, if I wanna go from Jodhpur to Chennai versus Jodhpur to London, right, those 2 are 2 completely different problems.Now if you say, should I take a bike for both, then you're not looking at the problems in same perspective. One place you have to go to London, one place you have to go to Chennai. So I don't think you should just compare them. It it completely depends on your passion, what you wanna do in life. I have always believed and it's not only me.Everyone says that. Right? Follow your passion. But I have truly believed that. If you follow your passion, work doesn't seem like work.It's it seems like fun. Like, why did I come here today? I could have been sitting with my family, enjoying chilling out, watching Netflix, go to a movie. I'm here because I love talking to students. I love visiting colleges.I love sharing my experiences. So now I don't feel, oh, why am I here? Why am I working on a Saturday? Nothing like that. So always choose what you will look at as fun or passion.Then it can be engineering. It can be marketing. It can be anything. Like I think the future is changing, and it's obviously faster than anyone have ever thought so what's the predictability of future we are not living in an ideal world so the future is not in a linear graph On that No one is ever predicted. Yeah.","Engineering is far from dead; it’s foundational to technological progress and innovation, and it will remain crucial in shaping the future. While it’s true that marketing increasingly emphasizes creativity, engineering drives the very tools, products, and infrastructure that marketing promotes. In fact, engineering and marketing are becoming more interdependent. For instance, digital marketing relies on advanced analytics, AI, and algorithms engineered to analyze customer data, personalize campaigns, and optimize engagement strategies.As technology evolves, engineering will continue advancing areas like automation, AI, and data science, all of which directly support marketing and other fields. Both disciplines require creativity, but in different ways — engineering in problem-solving and innovation, and marketing in communication and consumer engagement. Marketing may get more attention as it's customer-facing, but engineering remains the backbone of modern progress, meaning both are vital and will continue to grow hand-in-hand.","Both engineering and marketing are valuable fields, and their relative importance will continue to evolve in the age of AI. While AI can automate certain tasks in both fields, human creativity and critical thinking will remain essential. For instance, AI can generate marketing content, but human marketers are needed to develop compelling brand stories and understand audience psychology. Similarly, AI can assist engineers in design and analysis, but human engineers are required to oversee the process, make strategic decisions, and address unforeseen challenges. Ultimately, the most successful professionals will be those who can effectively combine technical skills with human qualities like creativity, empathy, and critical thinking.","Both engineering and marketing are dynamic and essential fields, each with its unique strengths and opportunities. Marketing undoubtedly demands a high degree of creativity, empathy, and understanding of human behavior—traits that AI finds challenging to replicate fully. However, creativity isn't confined to marketing alone. Engineering, too, requires innovative thinking and problem-solving skills, particularly in areas like design, product development, and sustainable solutions.AI can automate many routine and data-driven tasks in engineering, making processes more efficient and allowing engineers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their work. This symbiosis with AI enhances the field rather than diminishes it. On the other hand, marketing thrives on human creativity and the ability to understand and connect with audiences on an emotional level, an area where humans have a distinct edge over AI.Ultimately, the choice between engineering and marketing depends on one's interests and strengths. Engineering remains a robust career path with significant opportunities for innovation and impact, while marketing offers a platform for those passionate about creativity and communication. Both fields will continue to evolve, and their future success will likely hinge on the integration of technology and human ingenuity.","That's an interesting question comparing the prospects of engineering versus marketing. As an AI assistant without direct industry experience, I don't have a definitive take on which field is more or less viable for the future. However, I can share my perspective based on my general knowledge:

I wouldn't say engineering is ""dead"" compared to marketing. Engineering continues to be a critical and in-demand field, as technological innovation across industries relies heavily on skilled engineers. Areas like software engineering, robotics, renewable energy, and biomedical engineering all have significant potential for growth.

At the same time, I agree that marketing does require a high degree of creativity that may be harder for AI to fully replicate at this stage. The ability to develop effective branding, engage audiences, and devise novel marketing strategies relies on human intuition and imagination that current AI systems struggle with.

Ultimately, both engineering and marketing serve important and complementary functions in the business world. Engineering provides the technical expertise and innovations that enable new products and services, while marketing is crucial for identifying target audiences, crafting compelling narratives, and driving commercial success.

Rather than viewing it as a zero-sum game, the future may involve increased collaboration and integration between these two disciplines. Engineers may need to develop stronger marketing skills, while marketers benefit from a deeper understanding of the underlying technologies they promote.

So in summary, I wouldn't say either engineering or marketing is inherently ""the future"" - both fields have important roles to play, and their intersection may be where the most impactful innovations emerge. But the continued advancement of human creativity and emotional intelligence will likely remain crucial across many industries.

Does this provide a balanced perspective on the relative merits and futures of engineering versus marketing? Let me know if you have any other thoughts!","The notion that engineering is ""dead"" compared to marketing overlooks the critical role that engineering plays in innovation and technology development. Here’s my perspective:
Engineering's Vital Role: Engineering remains fundamental to creating products and solutions that drive industries forward. It involves problem-solving, technical expertise, and creativity—skills that are essential for developing new technologies13.
Marketing's Importance: Marketing indeed requires creativity and adaptability to connect with consumers effectively. However, it relies heavily on the products developed by engineers. Without innovative engineering solutions, marketing would have nothing to promote24.
Interdisciplinary Collaboration: The future lies in collaboration between engineering and marketing. Engineers can leverage insights from marketing to understand consumer needs better while marketers can benefit from technical knowledge to effectively communicate product value.","{'label': 'surprise', 'score': 0.4857010543346405}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9402951598167419}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9031926989555359}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5047953128814697}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9303536415100098}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.7008405923843384}",surprise,0.4857010543346405,neutral,0.9402951598167419,neutral,0.9031926989555359,neutral,0.5047953128814697,neutral,0.9303536415100098,neutral,0.7008405923843384
6,"Sir, as a director of engineering field. What you think about creativity and AI?","Creativity we need in everything. Even when you are writing a source code.

AI has the potential to augment human creativity by automating repetitive tasks, providing new insights, and enabling faster iterations. Engineers can leverage AI to design more innovative products, solve complex problems, and push the boundaries of what we can create. However, AI itself lacks the innate human ability to think outside the box and apply creative intuition to novel situations. Creativity remains a uniquely human trait, and AI can serve as a tool to enhance that creativity.","Creativity and AI are two sides of the same coin. AI has the potential to revolutionize how we create, design, and innovate. It can generate new ideas, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance our creative processes.

AI will handle repetitive tasks like data analysis, customer segmentation, ad targeting, and automation, improving efficiency and allowing teams to focus on higher-level decision-making. However, the human touch—creativity, emotional intelligence, and nuanced strategy—will always be vital in creating campaigns that truly connect with people. AI will act as a powerful tool for marketers, but not as a replacement for the entire marketing team.","While AI has the potential to automate many repetitive tasks in marketing, it's unlikely to completely replace human creativity and strategic thinking. AI can be a valuable tool to enhance efficiency and data-driven decision-making. However, tasks that require empathy, nuanced understanding, and original thinking will still necessitate human intervention.

AI-powered tools and technologies can automate various repetitive and data-driven tasks, such as campaign management, content creation, customer segmentation, and performance analysis. This can help marketing teams become more efficient and data-driven in their decision-making. However, I don't believe AI will entirely replace the human element of marketing. Creative, strategic, and customer-facing roles will still require the unique skills and insights that human marketers can provide.

15,Can AI be creative in the future as human and make advertisement that can cater a lot of people? Is it possible? ,"So I have this notion that I will always, and I have always looked at AI as a tool, as a means for me to achieve something else. I don't look at AI as an entity or AI as a channel.
I can only take some amount of help. So for example, AI has helped me generate lots of ideas. So it stimulates my mind in a certain way, gives me 4 different angles to think. But the way AI works is it is trained on past data. AI is trained on data over the Internet and large amounts of data.And when you think about it, nothing is new. What it's doing, it's doing 2 things. It has a very large dataset on which it is being trained. So it has lots of data in in simpler terms. And 2, it can contextually connect those and give you a nice answers, human like answer.That's what it does. Humans let's say there is a new context. There's something some new meme going on. This way AI has not been trained yet, and you want to create something on that particular meme. Yeah.I will not be able to give you that idea because it does not know. Right. So, yeah, to stimulate to, help to optimize AI is good. As a creative entity itself? I don't think so.Because creativity, I would never want to read a book. I would never want to, read a poem that is generated completely through AI because reading a book or reading, or going through a poem, it's all about the human side of it. The person who wrote it, what were they going through when they wrote it? What is the real meaning behind it? And it's very, very arbitrary.So you can think of its contextual. The context. But if I know that AI has written, all of that is lost on me. So I think, yeah, that's a way.","AI has made significant strides in areas like copywriting, design, and video production. While AI can generate creative outputs, its ability to create truly original and emotional campaigns remains limited. AI can follow patterns and produce content that mimics creativity, but it struggles to understand the deeper emotional context that human creativity can tap into. For example, AI can suggest catchy headlines or automate ad visuals, but the ability to craft a compelling, meaningful narrative or anticipate cultural shifts is still something humans do better. In the future, AI will enhance creativity but will not replace it.","AI can generate creative content, but it's still limited by the data it's trained on. While it can create ads that are visually appealing and technically sound, it may struggle to capture the nuances of human emotion and cultural context. True creativity often involves breaking norms and thinking outside the box, which is a skill that humans still excel at.","AI has already shown potential in creative tasks such as content generation, design, and video editing. However, true creativity often involves emotional depth and cultural context, which AI might struggle to fully replicate2. While AI can produce engaging and personalized content, human oversight and input will still be necessary to ensure the content resonates with diverse audiences.","AI and Creativity in Advertising: While AI is making rapid advancements in various creative domains, such as generating images, writing content, and even composing music, I believe that true creative excellence in advertising will still require a significant human element. Crafting impactful, emotionally resonant, and culturally relevant advertising campaigns requires a deep understanding of human psychology, cultural nuances, and creative storytelling – abilities that AI has not yet fully mastered. That said, I do believe AI will increasingly be used to assist and augment human creativity, generating ideas, concepts, and content that marketers can then refine and optimize.","AI has the potential to be creative in generating advertisements that cater to diverse audiences. Current advancements in generative AI allow for the creation of tailored content that can resonate with various demographics. However, while AI can produce creative outputs based on data patterns, it may lack the nuanced understanding of human emotions and cultural contexts that drive truly impactful advertising.

Right?So in your industry, sir,  what percentage of these repetitive tasks doing  persons will become obsolete? And how much percentage of these type of jobs would be, negligible in their coming years? What do you think about that?"," I think the jobs will evolve. A very good example of it would be when Ford was establishing and making cars mainstream, there was a major concern with the  people who ride on horses who make the carriages possible.. Right? So you sit down in the carriage, the horse will pull it. So the person who was responsible for the horse, they will all go out of jobs. That was a major concern.And there were protests. If that was heard properly, and the development of the internal combustion engine was stopped or stopped from being mainstream. We wouldn't have cars today. Also, does that mean that the job of the horse rider did not evolve? It did evolve.They became drivers or they became something else. Does this mean that society as a whole had a massive negative impact because of those jobs going out of practice? No. Similarly, AI is not going to take away jobs. It's going to make the job market evolve a lot.There is  a saying, I read it somewhere.

AI and machine learning tools will likely continue to reduce the need for human involvement in these areas, but jobs requiring creativity, strategy, and emotional intelligence will remain. In the near future, I’d estimate that 30-40% of routine tasks could be automated, which could affect lower-skill roles in marketing departments. However, the percentage of jobs that become ""obsolete"" entirely will be minimal—most people will transition to higher-level roles that focus on creative or strategic functions, which AI cannot easily replicate.","In the marketing industry, a significant portion of repetitive tasks, such as data entry, email campaigns, and social media scheduling, can be automated using AI.

The exact percentage may vary, but a significant portion of repetitive tasks will likely become automated.","Repetitive Tasks and Job Displacement: It's true that AI and automation will likely displace a significant portion of repetitive, data-driven marketing tasks in the coming years. Based on industry trends and research, I estimate that up to 30-40% of current marketing roles focused on repetitive, routine work could become obsolete or require significant retraining. However, this displacement will likely be balanced by the creation of new, more specialized marketing roles that leverage AI and data to drive strategic and creative decision-making. The key will be for marketing professionals to continuously upskill and adapt to the changing landscape.","The rise of AI will indeed render many repetitive tasks obsolete in the marketing industry. Tasks such as data entry, basic customer service interactions, and routine analytics are likely to see significant reductions in personnel requirements as AI tools become more capable.

It would have eventually been replaced by some other language.  as, working professionals, I think this is one of our major responsibilities to keep ourselves upskilled. Of course, there will be a few things that AI will completely automate and humans might not be needed for that.And if you think you're in  one such job, it's highly, highly recommended that you upscale yourself and try to gain skills that make you a better resource in a completely different aspect. Because a certain company has laid off a certain amount of people  and the reason fr that is AI has automated, It does not mean all the companies of the world will eventually get rid of all their human counterparts.No. That is a over exaggeration. Yeah. It also gives an opportunity for people to open up their eyes. This is a very rude awakening that please please upscale yourself.","There is no doubt that AI and automation have contributed to some layoffs, particularly in roles that involve repetitive tasks. Many businesses are adopting AI solutions to improve efficiency and reduce costs, which can sometimes lead to downsizing. However, it’s important to note that AI also creates new job opportunities in tech, strategy, and management roles. The challenge is that AI-driven changes in industries demand workers to adapt and upskill in areas like data science, AI management, and digital marketing. Companies that are laying off employees may not always be doing so because of AI alone, but rather as part of a broader strategy to remain competitive in a fast-changing environment.","The recent wave of layoffs in various industries can be attributed to multiple factors, including economic downturns, changing business models, and the adoption of automation technologies like AI. While AI can contribute to cost savings and efficiency, it's not the sole driver of layoffs.","Yes, there is a connection. As AI and automation technologies advance, some companies are reducing their workforce to cut costs and increase efficiency4. However, this trend also creates opportunities for employees to upskill and transition to more strategic and creative roles that AI cannot easily replace.","AI and Recent Layoffs: While the recent wave of layoffs in the tech industry, including some marketing teams, has been largely attributed to broader economic factors and market corrections, the increasing adoption of AI and automation has undoubtedly played a role.

If I completely let AI generate my copy and generate my collaterals, images, and It will be very substandard.It will not target the right audiences. It will not resonate with them. In future, it will be 100%. And, when that happens, as I keep saying, upskilling and all that. So I'll give you a very, recent example when, Charge GPT happened,There was a major concern among content writers that content writing as a profession, as a as work  will not exist for humans anymore. I was just having a conversation about 2 or 3 weeks ago with, a content writer. They said that they have started charging more. Their demand has increased. Can you believe that?The reason for that is generative AI produces work that is blank. Generative AI produces work with certain prompts. A certain content writer will always create better prompts because they know what they want. The output should have nuances and imperfections so that it feels more human. And the whole world is now trained on identifying what is AI written and what is not.But as you said, in the future, it might become very difficult for us to differentiate. AI will evolve but so will humans, and we will figure out the next thing. So I don't think in all my honesty, I don't think there is a major scare that AI will take away jobs. It definitely will take away jobs if you are not upskilling yourself. But if it was not AI, then something else would have taken away your job.","While AI tools can certainly improve efficiency and productivity in marketing—by automating tasks like email campaigns, ad targeting, or social media management—marketing still relies heavily on human insight.

The subtle ability to sense a candidate’s potential or to make instinctual judgments about whether someone might be a great fit for the company is something AI can’t replicate. However, if AI were to evolve to a point where it could deeply understand and predict human behavior in complex, unpredictable environments, that might be where it could fully replace some human roles in talent acquisition.","In my 15+ years of experience, the human element in talent acquisition is irreplaceable.  Specifically:

Judgment and Intuition: Years of experience give me a gut feeling about a candidate's potential. It's more than just qualifications on paper.
Strategic Talent Planning: Understanding future organizational needs and aligning them with talent acquisition requires human foresight and strategic thinking.
Coaching and Development: Guiding new hires, fostering a positive work environment, and motivating employees – these require human empathy and leadership.
AI can be amazing at automating tasks, but it can't replace the human ability to build relationships, assess complex qualities, and foster a positive company culture.","In my 15 years of experience, the one thing that machines or AI can never replace is human empathy. Understanding the candidate’s motivations, aspirations, and cultural fit requires a level of emotional intelligence that AI currently lacks. If machines were ever to develop true empathy and the ability to understand complex human emotions, they might come closer to replacing some aspects of my job. But for now, the human touch in building relationships and making personalized, empathetic decisions remains irreplaceable.","In my view, the ability to build genuine relationships and understand the nuances of human behavior is something machines can never fully replicate. While AI can analyze data and recognize patterns, it cannot empathize or read the subtleties of interpersonal interactions in the way a human can. The art of nurturing relationships, understanding emotional intelligence, and fostering team dynamics are essential aspects of talent acquisition that require a human touch.","In my 15 years of experience in talent acquisition, one aspect that machines can never fully replicate is emotional intelligence. The ability to connect with candidates on a personal level, understand their motivations, and assess cultural fit is something that requires human intuition and empathy.
If AI were to develop a level of emotional intelligence comparable to humans, it could potentially replace many aspects of recruitment. However, even then, the richness of human interaction—such as building trust and rapport—would still be challenging for machines to emulate fully.","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.935249924659729}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5410382151603699}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47121462225914}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9507462382316589}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9362139701843262}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.7897374629974365}",neutral,0.935249924659729,neutral,0.5410382151603699,neutral,0.47121462225914,neutral,0.9507462382316589,neutral,0.9362139701843262,neutral,0.7897374629974365

Right.why you think it is like that ?","
why you think it is like that ?It it is Because if a man has to be alpha  has to make a career and be the alpha, society will be very, very and I'm talking I'm much older than you guys. I'm talking about good 30, 40 years back. A male designer, unless you're gay and you're already a social outcast, then you can be  designer. Because if you are  gay, then you are already an  outcast. Right? It's a stereotype. It's a but it's not true. They they can be non gay designers also. But with men who are kept from taking softer career like design because it was considered this is a feminine thing to designing. So we have has shown discrimination to men also.For example, let me take a non professional example. Maternity  leave is given to women. I understand a pregnancy because a child is being born by the mother, so she needs her leave for delivery and recuperation. But if you actually want to see anything beyond nursing for the child from the age of 1 to 18, parenting is a gender neutral role. A father can be a strong friend, philosopher guide to the child, but again, a very, very interesting bias is that if we encourage men to be participating in the roles of as a parent, I've had senior people who would actually object to it and say that is there no wife at home.But why should we discriminate if the man wants to go and be a good father and be there for his child?  So we what we don't realize is that the the struggle is not at a hiring or a gender representation in the manufacturing segment because I represent that. I'm sure it's it's, a similar struggle in other nontraditional segments are the problem is less. Like the finance sector , you have much higher representation of women.Manufacturing sector is still at an abysmal 10, 12%. Right? The problem is the nature  of the society that we live in and while I agree with you that on pure play logic , these these these percentage, they are women and 80% if they are men, then it's definitely not going to that piece of data, if you just take only that, it is not going to be fair to say I'm going to hire 50- 50 because you're picking less from the larger pool of men technically. But you I would request you to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Take a look at the bigger picture and take a slightly more empathetic and equitable stand on the journey.If women were kept away from mainstream, let us bring them back into mainstream. And if men were kept away from taking domestic responsibilities, let us encourage them to take domestic responsibility. There is what we call an intersectionality.

27,"If, in technical job, there are no reservation for 50% like per women. There will be more opportunity for women's that will be created and that will attract more women's to do engineering. Correct. And the economy will stabilize, like,both men and women will be 50 percent 50 percent in the future. But most of the population, like, in the 4th year of BTECh, I have realized most of my peers do not agree with this. They think that there is some discrimination happening with them. And womens are given more opportunity. Because there are 20% women and job hiring is 50 - 50 percent. How you as a cheif diversity officer , you proof yourself right in front of these people who feel discriminated?","So the logic of the organization is that I I want to normalize the societal representation. Now the society is 49- 51 there and I want to do a 40 - 60 as an organization. I don't care that your institute doesn't have enough women.I'll take it to normalize it with the societal numbers. So the question we are trying to solve is not that why are women being hired. The question we should try to solve is why are they enough qualified women and that's a much deeper problem, my friend. I think that diversity will increase the numbers slowly slowly. There will be 50 percent women .","I understand the perception that women may sometimes be hired because of their gender rather than their capabilities. This is an unfortunate stereotype that often arises from the visibility of diversity programs. However, I firmly believe that women, like men, earn their positions based on their skills, experience, and merit. In fact, diversity hiring programs aim to ensure that candidates are evaluated on equal terms, irrespective of gender, while also considering the broader context of historical underrepresentation. Over time, as we continue to build a more inclusive and meritocratic environment, the value of diversity will be better understood and respected. Hiring committees, by nature, strive for competence and skill. As society becomes more accustomed to diversity in leadership and technical roles, perceptions will shift, and there will be more recognition of the value that diversity brings to the table, benefiting everyone.","It's understandable that some individuals may feel disadvantaged by affirmative action policies. However, it's important to emphasize that these initiatives are not about penalizing anyone but about creating a more equitable future. By fostering a diverse workforce, we are building stronger organizations and a more prosperous society. To address concerns about perceived discrimination, we can engage in open dialogue, provide education on the benefits of diversity, and highlight success stories of women in STEM. Additionally, we can implement mentorship programs and provide support systems to help all employees thrive","Implementing gender reservations in technical jobs can indeed create more opportunities for women and attract them to engineering fields. This proactive approach helps balance gender representation over time. While some may feel discriminated against, it's important to communicate that these measures are temporary and aimed at creating a more balanced and equitable future. Over time, as more women enter and succeed in these fields, the need for such reservations will diminish.","Let me address this concern directly: our diversity initiatives aren't about discrimination but about creating equal opportunities. Consider this – if a room has been lit only on one side for years, temporarily using stronger lights on the darker side doesn't mean you're discriminating against the already-lit side; you're creating balance. We ensure our hiring processes maintain high standards while removing unconscious biases. Every candidate, regardless of gender, must meet our technical requirements. We're not lowering the bar; we're removing the invisible barriers that prevent qualified candidates from reaching it.","I understand that some may feel discriminated against due to gender-based hiring practices.

28,"Ma'am, like, this is a this is a great act of, like, including diversity in one's one organization, but this act is leading to another perception. The perception which is, women are getting jobs or let's say a good job just because they are women, and it is it is creating a perception that they aren't capable of that because many men or male that are even more capable of women are not getting selected and only the females are getting selected which, and which creates a perception that she got the job just because she's a woman. No offense though. But it is my question. After 5 years or let's say in, upcoming future only, what do you think would be the, respect towards a job or a hiring committee through, like, if we talk about from the perspective of a crowd, , would hiring committee be biased towards women or would they give equal opportunity to male as well?","See, I think it's important for organizations to pick up something I call post correction. Post correction when I decide to have a policy where I will equally recruit men and women. If I have 10 roles, I'll recruit 5 and 5. That's my policy. You may have organizations which don't have that policy.Of course. Yeah. The choice you need to make as a human being, and I reiterate this point because it is not a professional discussion. It's actually a societal discussion. The point you should make as a human being, the choice you should make as a human being is that there has been historic exclusion of women and for other kinds of categories.We we we didn't even recognize the third gender till we have to government had to take out a policy to say this is we recognize the 3rd gender. Imagine being in existence, say, you're  not recognized. a male have only raise the issue after system stom favoring men  , you didn't have to really bother about getting excluded. We didn't notice who else was getting excluded.if you are a diversity candidate, prove it by your work. Right? If your if your work is the truth, you don't need to care about anybody else's opinion. Right? So at the end of the day, if you're best at your task, okay, and you don't need an organization to validate how good you are.So organizations to me that support DEI, if they're doing something right to correct or wrong, that's over 200 years old. Those are all that the woman first entered the work field, workplace. And after, whether you believe it or not, till now we are discussing loose and washrooms for women. Factory because men work here, we dont have female washroom.So women have to either walk miles or they have to hold, which is bad for their health. And we don't realize this because it's a fundamental Of course. Right? So it's a correction we need to make collectively. I, in no way, suggest that representation of women in turn means, a discrimination against men.The hiring is always done on competencies as long as the competency competencies match, we didnt  do a 50-50. At no point is the relaxation of qualification. But to that merit, the only thing to say by that at the end of the day, men have to be allies to this process because of the historic injustice done to many categories of society and I'm not at that point women. Any minority group which has not got its due, if men don't play an active role in building that society that we all wish for, trust me, it will happen that even men will one day wake up and realize that patriarchal society kept them from becoming better versions of themselves. And when men internalize that perception and don't know how to process it, it converts into anger, frustration, ego issues.Right? Because we have not told men it's okay. It's fine. Right? We have we have forced boys and we have forced men to become a certain version which is not healthy for them either.That stereotype that men don't cry or multiple. That obviously I would love it when we have a society when individuals are allowed to be who they want. So if there's a man who's happy being at home and doing his work from home and taking care of the baby and he's happy that way, let him do that. If a man wants to go up with good organization and become a CEO, let him let him do that. Similarly, for a woman, both those choices should be above favorable.Right? So to me, it's a societal framework we need to look at. Yes. It might create momentary insecurity meant that but trust me, there's enough for everyone. There will be opportunities for everybody as long as the decisions are taken on merit.And this is my my personal opinion. I I am representing an organization, so it's also important that you understand the context of it. Tata Motors as an organization believes in diversity of inclusion from a business use case and as a value use case value based use case. 
","Thank you for raising this important question. It’s a complex and meaningful topic, especially as organizations aim to build more inclusive and diverse workforces. 

To address the perception that women are sometimes seen as receiving jobs ""just because they are women,"" it's important to recognize the broader context. Diversity initiatives were introduced to correct historic imbalances and bring varied perspectives to the table, which benefits companies in terms of innovation, problem-solving, and overall success. However, these initiatives are not about hiring someone solely based on gender; they’re about ensuring everyone has an equal opportunity to showcase their abilities.

In a well-functioning hiring process, diversity doesn’t mean lowering standards—it means removing biases that may have previously overlooked talented individuals, including women, based on factors unrelated to capability. Most companies are striving to build hiring practices that are merit-based, transparent, and inclusive, where every candidate, regardless of gender, is evaluated fairly. 

Looking ahead, in the next 5 years or so, I believe hiring committees will continue to work towards a more balanced and objective approach. As organizations increasingly use structured, data-driven hiring practices, they will prioritize skills, competencies, and potential above everything else. This means that everyone, men and women alike, will compete on equal grounds, with diversity viewed as a valuable, complementary asset rather than the sole hiring criterion.

Ultimately, when hiring practices are transparent and unbiased, and when diverse teams show their value, respect for hiring committees will strengthen, and the perception of ""bias"" will lessen. The goal is not to choose one gender over another but to ensure the best candidates are recognized and included, regardless of background. This way, everyone has the opportunity to contribute their talents fully, and organizations can reap the benefits of a truly inclusive workforce.","Your concern about the perception of women in the workplace is valid. However, it's important to remember that diversity initiatives are not about lowering standards. Companies are committed to hiring the best talent, regardless of gender. As more women enter STEM fields and prove their capabilities, these perceptions will gradually change. It's essential to continue promoting meritocracy and ensuring that all candidates are evaluated fairly based on their skills and qualifications. Over time, as diversity becomes more normalized, these concerns will diminish, and we will have a workforce that truly reflects the talent and potential of all individuals.","The perception that women get jobs solely based on gender needs to be addressed through transparency and merit-based evaluation. It’s essential for hiring committees to ensure that all candidates, regardless of gender, meet the required qualifications and skills for the job. Over time, as the presence of competent and qualified women in the workforce increases, these perceptions will change. In the future, hiring practices should continue to be fair and unbiased, focusing on the skills and potential of each candidate.","This is a crucial concern, and I'm glad you raised it. The perception you mentioned is something we actively work to address. First, our hiring processes are rigorous and merit-based for all candidates. We maintain stringent technical assessment criteria regardless of gender. Second, we invest heavily in showcasing the achievements and contributions of our diverse workforce through internal case studies and success stories. The results speak for themselves – our diverse teams consistently deliver exceptional results, challenging any notion that standards were compromised.Looking ahead, I believe hiring committees will become increasingly sophisticated in balancing diversity with merit. We're already seeing this evolution at Tata Motors, where our focus is shifting from pure numerical targets to creating an inclusive environment where everyone can thrive. The goal isn't just diverse hiring; it's building a workplace where every individual's potential is recognized and developed, regardless of their background.","The perception that women receive jobs solely based on their gender is a concern we take seriously. Our commitment at Tata Motors is to ensure that all hiring processes are merit-based while also being inclusive. Over time, as more women succeed in technical roles, we expect societal perceptions to shift positively. Our focus is on building a culture where capability is recognized irrespective of gender, thereby fostering respect for all individuals based on their skills and contributions rather than their gender.In conclusion, while challenges exist in achieving true diversity, our commitment at Tata Motors remains steadfast in creating an inclusive environment that values every individual's contribution, ultimately driving innovation and success within the organization and society at large.","{'label': 'anger', 'score': 0.5334872603416443}","{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.6309048533439636}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.771134614944458}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9094558358192444}","{'label': 'joy', 'score': 0.6318373084068298}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4625855088233948}",anger,0.5334872603416443,joy,0.6309048533439636,neutral,0.771134614944458,neutral,0.9094558358192444,joy,0.6318373084068298,neutral,0.4625855088233948

So, and especially with AI, I think the revolution has to be very fast. Earlier, the revolution is to probably be like a decade.This revolution is definitely gonna be trimmed down by, I think, 1 third or one fourth time what they took. Reason being because a lot of applications that are coming out day in, day out. Right? A lot of applications coming out. You enter a room and then you just say that switch off the lights, turn on the lights, the lights will be turned on.Right? Faster executions as well. Creatives, let's say, there there earlier, there were a lot of digital marketers who used to be designing for posters or media files that have to be uploaded. Now you just have to type in what exactly you need from the AI and it is done. Yeah.So so I think it's all about moving towards higher efficiency, and that is the demand of the market and demand of the human race. So you should definitely do that and embrace it as a positive aspect.  ","The AI revolution has a different trajectory from past technological revolutions because it's rapidly integrated into almost every aspect of our lives. However, after the initial explosive growth, it will likely enter a ""maturity phase,"" where it's part of the background infrastructure rather than a daily headline. In the next decade, AI may become so ubiquitous that it’s less talked about, like electricity today. The real shift will come in how it’s integrated—AI will continue to transform industries, but we may see less excitement around ""AI"" itself and more focus on applications and ethical considerations.","The AI revolution isn't a fad.  It's more akin to the industrial revolution – a fundamental shift that will continue to evolve and integrate into everything we do. Here's why it's different:

The AI ""ceiling"" keeps rising: AI capabilities are constantly expanding. We will continue to discover new applications and functionalities that wouldn't have been considered possible before.
AI and humans as partners: Instead of a replacement, AI will become a tool that augments and empowers humans. The future is about human-AI collaboration.","The AI revolution is likely to have a long-lasting impact, much like the internet and IT revolutions. However, unlike previous technological waves that had distinct phases, AI's integration into society is ongoing and evolving. AI will continue to expand into new areas, improving efficiency and creating new possibilities. The extent of this revolution is vast, and as AI becomes more sophisticated, it will become an integral part of many industries. Rather than fading away, AI is expected to continue growing and transforming the way we live and work","Regarding the AI revolution, I believe it will continue to evolve and integrate into various sectors, but like previous technological revolutions, it may plateau as we reach a point of saturation. The key difference with AI is its potential for continuous learning and adaptation, which might extend its relevance longer than past revolutions.","The AI revolution has the potential to extend far beyond previous technological revolutions like the internet or IT. However, it may face challenges as technology matures and industries adapt. The initial excitement could lead to saturation, where advancements become incremental rather than transformative. While we may see significant changes over the next decade, there could be a plateau after several years as businesses integrate AI into their operations and society adjusts to its implications.","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6513526439666748}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8469003438949585}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6973595023155212}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8987451791763306}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.9173399806022644}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.8229382038116455}",neutral,0.6513526439666748,neutral,0.8469003438949585,neutral,0.6973595023155212,neutral,0.8987451791763306,neutral,0.9173399806022644,neutral,0.8229382038116455

Like, we can't predict the 10 years from now, but what will be after 2 years? What will be the job scenarios in software engineering or data science or any technical jobs?","See, I think, first and foremost, probably if somebody would have asked me what is the future gonna be like after 10 years, I would not I would probably be been saying that AI is definitely gonna revolutionize. Right?
Now AI has happened. Now just that as I mentioned out earlier as well, like the timeline in order to make change or the the the pace at which the changes will happen will be very fast, very fast, super fast. Right? So what you need to be, skilled with is ensuring that your fundamentals are intact so that you stand out. 2nd, you need to know these tools that are coming up, right, and the technology that is evolving.

You need to upgrade yourself day in and day out, day in and day out, day in and day out. Right? And until and unless you don't do that, you'll be filled in a way for sure. Yeah. So So the pace is gonna be very fast.

In case if you ask me that what exactly is it that it's gonna look like after 10 years, I don't think that I can make a comment on that, but it is definitely gonna be very fast. Next 2, 3 years is something that I can comment on that, you should be having more of AI jobs, prompt engineering jobs, etcetera etcetera for that matter. ML jobs for that matter, reach crunching the data, reading the data, etcetera, etcetera, developing applications from AI. That is something where we are moving towards. After 10 years, I don't know, to be very honest, with the pace that we are moving at right now.","In the near term, we can expect a high demand for roles in AI, machine learning, data science, and software engineering, especially those skilled in AI ethics, interpretability, and implementation.
